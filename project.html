            <h4>CPU Scheduling Simulator</h4>
            <p><b>CPU Scheduling</b> is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS at least select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution. The selection process will be carried out by the CPU scheduler. It selects one of the processes in memory that are ready for execution.</p>

            <h4>3-in-1 Simulator- Memory Allocation, Page Replacement and Disk Scheduling</h4>
            <p><b>Memory allocation</b> is a process by which computer programs and services are assigned with physical or virtual memory space. Memory allocation is the process of reserving a partial or complete portion of computer memory for the execution of programs and processes. Memory allocation is achieved through a process known as memory management</p>
            <p><b>Page replacement algorithms</b> decide which memory pages to page out, sometimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory needs to be allocated.</p>
            <p>Input/output scheduling is the method that computer operating systems use to decide in which order the block I/O operations will be submitted to storage volumes. I/O scheduling is sometimes called <b>disk scheduling</b>. Disk scheduling is important because: Multiple I/O requests may arrive by different processes and only one I/O request can be served at a time by the disk controller.</p>

            <h4>TO-DO Mobile Application</h4>
            <p>Last year, we were able to create a mobile application with the help of the framework of reactNative. I had a hard time doing this project because the syntax is totally different from the usual programming language I encountered like C and Java. It's sytax has very much familiar of JavaScript and I do not have a background idea with the JavaScript</p>
